Hi, My name is Branko Sabadi. I've been working in IT industry for last 13 years. My IT journey began in year 2009 where I started working as a service desk technician.
Nowadays, I work as solution architect focused around SfB/Teams voice related stuff and on migrating of M365 workloads. I also like developing custom solutions wrapped around PowerShell. Quest for knowledge in IT industry is never-ending and that's the reason for writing this blog. Being aware that memory is short, blog would be a good instrument to document some exotic stuff encountered.

#### I enjoy working in following areas:
- Microsoft Teams
- Exchange Online
- Skype for Business/Lync
- Azure (IaaS)

#### I'm also have good understanding of mail gateways and related products such as:
- Exchange Online Protection / ATP
- Cisco ESA/IronPort
- Proofpoint Protection Server
- Proofpoint TRAP

#### When not at work

I love spending time with my familly. I'm a father of two, husband. Also, when time allows I'm into sports such as snowboarding, cycling and underwater spearfishing.
