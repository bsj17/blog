Hi, My name is Branko Sabadi. I've been working in IT industry for last 13 years. My IT journey began in year 2009 where I started working as a service desk technician.
Nowadays, I work as solution architect focused around SfB/Teams voice related stuff and on migrating of M365 workloads. 

I also like developing custom solutions wrapped around PowerShell. Quest for knowledge in IT industry is never-ending and that's the reason for writing this blog. Being aware that memory is short, blog would be a good instrument to document some exotic stuff encountered.
