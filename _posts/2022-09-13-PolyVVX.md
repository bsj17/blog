Half year ago I've been asked to evluate interesting project where customer had more then 800 Poly VVX phones. That's a quite an invesment if you ask me. So, long story short these phone can work in two modes SIP and SfB. Since SfB is fading away this hardware could be recycled by registering it to [Microsoft SIP Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/sip-gateway-plan).

Steps to register phone to MS SIP GW are streight forward and it's not a problem. Problem occures when you have this volume. Other challengs is when you think how to centraly manage these phone. Yes, there are tools that can do this for you. But what if the ask is if you can be precise and do a staged migration not a cutover?

Well this where we come to the point of writing this article. I ran into interesting project written by James Cussen named [Poly-VVX-Teams-SIP-Gateway-Tool](https://github.com/jamescussen/Poly-VVX-Teams-SIP-Gateway-Tool). It looked promising so I went ahead and get sample of Poly VVX 500 and 600.

Shell tool was working spot on. There was a glith in GUI which James quickly mended. I was really impressend on how to tool worked. POC went fine I will update article when mass migration actually starts, so far so good, exactly what I was looking for. Thank you James!
