Hello world! <br> You gotta start somewhere. I've decided to start with blog. It's based on Beautiful Jekyll created by [Dean Attali](https://beautifuljekyll.com/). It's a static site generator based on Jekyll.

Great thing about it blog posts are written in markup file (.md) which is simple and streightforward to learn. Further more GitHub is hosting website for free and there's no additional cost (except domain).

Before actual publishing to GitHub I'm using Docker container where site is generated locally firs. After pushing  which triggers github actions and with that I've started using CI/CD without being aware of it.:)
