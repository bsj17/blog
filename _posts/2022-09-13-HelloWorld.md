Hello world! <br> You gotta start somewhere. I've decided to start with blog. It's based on Beautiful Jekyll static site generator created by [Dean Attali](https://beautifuljekyll.com/).

Great thing about it, blog posts are written in markup file (.md) which is simple and streightforward to learn. Furthermore GitHub is hosting website for free and there's no additional cost (except domain). If you want to try it yourself [check it out](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme). It literally takes 3 minutes.

Before actual publishing to GitHub I'm using Docker container to test out the content where web site is generated locally first. After being happy with results I push code to GitHub triggering github actions and with that I've started using CI/CD without being aware of it.:)

That's it for first post. Thanks for reading!
